# psmp-ontology: A Reference Ontology Online Professional Data

Psmp-Ontology aims to provide a representation of career-related personal data found on Professional Social Media Platforms (PSMPs). Grounded in Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), it formalizes key concepts such as employment, education, competences, and certifications.

This is the repository to store all the artefacts of the PSMP ontology. A reference version in OntoUML (psmp_ontology.vpp and psmp_ontology.json) is included in this repository.

To use the OntoUML version, use the OntoUML Visual Paradigm plugin.
